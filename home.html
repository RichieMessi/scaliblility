            Moreover, we can implement our API's with newer languages such as Golang and Elm which are specifically designed for concurrency. Such languages can take full advantage of multiple cores on the machines and provide optimum performance . (Docker and Kubernetes are both written in golang)

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Building the front end in React or Angular and backend in Node</h2>

            <p>React and angular are the defacto goto's (my personal opinion) for big organisations to build their web apps due to high traffic. High traffic leads to higher API calls and often requires extreme DOM manipulation. React's JSX and Angular's Typescript both handle this with ease  as they follow a comopnent based approach. So choosing either one would be a good choice. </p>
            <p>I would personally go with React as it favors functional style of programming where functions can be composed into other functions. This is the very reason why I love JavaScript.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>For the backend API calls, Node is a brillliant choice as it takes power of the V8 engine written in C++ and C. Javascript has always been single threaded. But  Node has the cool feature of read even print loop.
                Now the code can still flow downwards executing the other instructions and can wait for the pending task simultaneously. Promises and async await are great examples. Now both front end and backend can be written in JS which means theres no context switch. This leads to code reusability which is always a plus</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title text-primary">How Docker is the key to this architecture?</h2>

            <p>Docker provides light weight images which can run as a container. One image can have multuple instances. With just a few click, I was able to spin up a docker container with Ubuntu Operating System on my Windows. With just one single command, one can run an instance of MongoDB, Angular, Node etc - create a docker compose file and in a few seconds, an entire mean app can be created and that too without installing any other software.</p>

            <p class="lead">It does not end there. Docker solves the common problem of "it works on my machine but it does not work on yours" among developers. Docker provides an isolated environment therefore, all the developers can work in the exact same environment which leads to less bugs. </p>

            <p class="lead text-danger">All these are my personal opinions which I would consider before attempting to scale an application. There is a lot more to it and I am still learning</p>

            <p class="mb-0">Microsoft Azure is a great choice for developers like myself who are still learning about dev ops. Azure provides a clean user interface (all written in typescript) and everything gets done easy and quick. With a few commands, I deployed a docker container for my question 1 in azure. Great expreience. Adding multiple deployment slots for staging of an app to test a feature before release is very easy. It picks up a project right from my github and upon some configurations and scripting, it can be linked to the dockerhub aswell. So whenever a container is updated, Azure picks up the change. There are app services that can help scale individual parts of an application both horizontally and vertically.  </p>
